can probably do something like

def documentation(&block)
  doc_instance = whatever()
  doc.instance_eval &block
end

For all "regular" methods this will evaluate with the doc_instance methods taking presedence over other methods.
Moreover, you cannot write somethind that would cause the current block to delegate things like:
  name = "x"
to the context object, as ruby will create a local variable in the context of the block even if there is a name=()
 method... you'd have to write slef.name="y" to do it anyway.
